11. Confidentiality 
11.1 Subject to clause 11.2, each party shall: 
(a) keep confidential all Confidential Information of the other party which it receives  in connection with this agreement; 
(b) apply to it no lesser security measures and degree of care than those which it  takes in protecting its own Confidential Information and in any event no less  than that which a reasonable person or business would take in protecting its  own confidential information; 
(c) only use such Confidential Information as strictly necessary for the  performance of, or exercise of its rights under, this Agreement; 
(d) not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party (other than its  professional advisers, officers, employees, agents, contractors and sub contractors on a 'need to know' basis as strictly required for the purposes of  this Agreement and subject to each such person being bound by an obligation  of confidentiality equivalent to this clause 11); and 
(e) promptly, upon request and, in any event, upon termination of this agreement  (for whatever reason), return to the other party all materials (in whatever form)  incorporating, embodying or recording any such Confidential Information in its  possession or control and, if requested by the other party, certify in writing that  it has done so. 
11.2 Either party may disclose the other's Confidential Information to the extent required by  law or by any court, tribunal, regulator or other authority with competent jurisdiction to  order its disclosure (but only to the extent of such requirement). 
12. Term and termination 
12.1 This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until  terminated pursuant to this clause 12 (the "Term").  
12.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, either party may terminate this  Agreement on 30 days' written notice at that Party's convenience for no reason. 
12.3 Everlink may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect if you violate any  provision of this Agreement (including any failure to comply with the payment  provisions in clause 5). Where Everlink is entitled to terminate this Agreement, it may  instead at its option and without prejudice to its right to subsequently terminate this  Agreement, suspend your access to the API by disabling the API Key or otherwise. 
Any termination of this Agreement shall also terminate the licences granted to you hereunder. This does not impact any other rights of suspension that Everlink may have  under this Agreement. 
13. Consequences of termination 
13.1 Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason: 
(a) you, any Developer Users and/or any End Users shall immediately cease to  access, and discontinue all use of, the API, API Key and any Service Data;
UKMATTERS:58784950.4 
13 
(b) you shall pay to Everlink all of Everlink's unpaid invoices for any applicable  fees, and where no invoice has been submitted for services supplied, Everlink may submit an invoice which will be payable on receipt; and 
(c) you shall either return to Everlink, or destroy and remove from all computers,  hard drives, networks, and other storage media, all copies of any materials  licensed under this Agreement; 
(as applicable) and you shall, on request, certify to Everlink that such actions have  occurred. 
13.2 The termination of this Agreement for any reason will not affect: 
(a) any accrued rights or liabilities which either party may have by the time  termination takes effect; or 
(b) the coming into force or the continuation in force of any of its provisions that  expressly or by implication are intended to come into force or continue in force  on or after the termination. 
14. General 
14.1 You may not sub-license or assign, sub-contract or delegate any or all of your rights or  obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Everlink. 
14.2 Unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing, if a party: 
(a) fails to exercise or delays exercising or only exercises partially any right or  remedy provided under this Agreement or by law; or 
(b) agrees not to exercise or to delay exercising any right or remedy provided  under this Agreement or by law; 
then that party shall not be deemed to have waived and shall not be precluded or  restricted from further exercising that or any other right or remedy. 
14.3 If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be ineffective or  unenforceable, this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of  this agreement or this Agreement as a whole. If any provision of this Agreement is so  found to be ineffective or unenforceable but would be effective or enforceable if some  part of the provision were deleted, the provision in question shall apply with such  modification(s) as may be necessary to make it effective and enforceable. 
14.4 Nothing in this Agreement shall or is intended to create a partnership or joint venture  between the parties, constitute one party as agent of the other or give either party  authority to make or enter into commitments, assume liabilities or pledge credit on  behalf of the other party. Neither party may act as if it were, or represent (expressly or  by implying it) that it is, an agent of the other or has such authority. 
14.5 A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall not have any rights under or in  connection with it, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or  otherwise. 
14.6 If there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions in the main body of this  Agreement and the Schedules, the provisions in the main body of this Agreement shall  prevail.

14.7 This Agreement sets out all of the terms that have been agreed between the parties in  relation to the subjects covered by it and supersedes all previous agreements between  the parties relating to such subjects. Provided always that nothing in this clause 14.7 will operate to limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, no  other representations or terms shall apply or form part of this Agreement and each  party acknowledges that it has not been influenced to enter this Agreement by, and  shall have no rights or remedies (other than for breach of contract) in respect of,  anything the other party has said or done or committed to do, except as expressly  recorded in this Agreement. 
14.8 This Agreement is governed by English law. Both parties submit to the exclusive  jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any dispute arising out of or in connection  with this Agreement or its subject matter, but Everlink is also entitled to apply to any  court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce its  Intellectual Property Rights.
